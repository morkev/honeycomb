# Honeycomb
The task is to produce a matrix of 20 hexagon shaped widgets in a honeycomb arrangement. The matrix should be arranged in such a manner that there are five columns of four hexagons. The hexagons in columns one, three and five are aligned horizontally, whereas the hexagons in columns two and four occupy a lower position within the arrangement. 

Each hexagon should be the same colour, and should display a unique randomly selected single capital letter on the front. The application should now wait for the user to select a hexagon, either by using a pointing device, or by pressing a key that carries a corresponding letter on a hexagon.
